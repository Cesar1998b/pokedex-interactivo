# Angular-Pokedex

[Let's go](https://angular-pokedex-mu.vercel.app/)üî•

This project is an application build with Angular inspired in Pokedex Challenge by [Codealo](https://codealo.dev/).Using the [Pok√©Api](https://pokeapi.co/), this app will list Pok√©mon, and display details for a given Pok√©mon, also have a search bar and a favorite button.

## Getting Started
